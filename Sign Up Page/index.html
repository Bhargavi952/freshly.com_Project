          <h3 class="faq-title">How many portions are your meal?</h3>
          <p class="faq-text">
            All of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an average
            adult. Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners
            (or lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at just about
            13 ounces, which is about 10% larger than similar competitors.
            What’s even better: our meals average just 500 calories and range
            from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do
            offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s perfect for a family of
            4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you can always order multiple
            subscriptions.
