        <h3 class="faq-title">How many portions are your meal?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          All of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an average
          adult. Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners
          (or lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at just about 13
          ounces, which is about 10% larger than similar competitors. What’s
          even better: our meals average just 500 calories and range from 300 to
          650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do offer a 12 meal
          per week subscription (it’s perfect for a family of 4 looking for 3
          meals per week). Plus, you can always order multiple subscriptions.
